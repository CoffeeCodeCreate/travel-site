What is rem?
-> a unit size that is relative to the root of the page
-> most browsers have a base font size of 16 pixels
-> so that equals 1rem
-> 1.5rem = 24px
-> etc.

Why use rem?
-> Not everyone has their browser configured the same way
-> Our website will scale to the user's font-size preference
