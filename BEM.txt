What BEM stands for:

Block -> independant reusable part of our design
example: headerSection

Element -> belongs to a block. cannot be used outside that block.
example: headerSection_title, headerSection_subtitle


Modifier -> can be used on a block or an element to indicate a change to the default state 
            of an object

example: headerSection_title--orange


BEM Overview:

- CSS Selectors should target elements with classes rather than type, descendent and cascade
    selectors.

- We limit the cascade, allowing us to move blocks around and reuse them around the page

- blocks can be nested inside other blocks

- we can identify patterns and then create single responsibility blocks or a block that does ONE job

- bem makes the relationship between HTML and CSS clear.
