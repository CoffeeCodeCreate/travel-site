NOTE: ONLY WORKS IF FOLLOWING THE BEM PHILOSOPHY

- In postcss, the parent selector or the root block selector can be replaced with an & 
when applying it to a child element selector that has the root selectors name in its name

- We can then NEST the ampersand with the child's name appended to it in the root selector

- This compiles to descendant selectors once postcss processes it.

EXAMPLE:

Instead of:

.baseHeader
{
    color: red;
}

.baseHeader__subtitle
{
    color: blue;
}

We can do this:

.baseHeader
{ 
    color: red 

    //child element
    &__subtitle
    {
        color: blue
    }    
}

which compiles back to this:


.baseHeader
{
    color: red;
}

.baseHeader__subtitle
{
    color: blue;
}
