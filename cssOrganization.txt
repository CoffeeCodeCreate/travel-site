We can use multiple css files that compile to one main css file

    Why do this? -> It becomes a lot easier to read and manipulate styles.

How can we do this?

We use the npm module: postcss-import 

We can use the keyword '@import "filePathToFile" ' in our main css file, at the very top.

    -> NOTE: this file is NOT the one in the temp folder thats the finished,
            compiled verson!
            Also: We do NOT need to include the extension .css

NOTE FOR NORMALIZE.CSS AND POSTCSS IMPORT:

-> If you have normalize.css as a dependancy you can import it through postcss-import
   by simply writing " @import "normalize.css" " without having to navigate to the node_modules
    folder!
